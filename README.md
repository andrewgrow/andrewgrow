### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ”­ I'm a Software Developer with extensive experience in different languages and frameworks.

ğŸŒ± My primary language is Java (and now Kotlin). Although I worked for many years as a mobile fullstack developer, I find myself more inclined towards backend work now. ğŸ‘¯ Currently, I'm seeking new experiences, which is why my repositories contain many "Hello-World" applications. ğŸ¤” 

If you're looking for someone who can be very useful to you, feel free to write to me. ğŸ’¬

I would be glad to connect with you! ğŸ˜„
